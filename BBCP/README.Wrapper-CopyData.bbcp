Wrapper-CopyData.bbcp
---------------------

This bash script  is a wrapper for the script CopyData.bbcp which is designed to test transfer of big size data (BigData) from local host 
to remote host using utility 'bbcp' over Internet.
This script invokes the script CopyData.bbcp and transfers it input parameters.

The script is run with the following input parameters:

Wrapper-CopyData.bbcp <TCPParametersFile> <BBCPConfig> <BaseDir> <SourceDirectory> [<RemoteUser>@]<RemoteHost> <DestinationDirectory/dev/null> [<Comments>]

where:

    TCPParametersFile -- a file (full path) containing a set of tcp streams numbers and tcp window sizes
    BBCPConfig -- a file (full path) for bbcp tcp tuning
    BaseDir -- directory (full path) where the script CopyData.bbcp creates subdirectory to store input and logging information
    SourceDirectory -- directory or single file (full path) containing files to be transferred to remote host. This directory is created 
                      using script 'create-test-file-dispersion.sh' (or create-test-file-sigma.sh). 
                      Files sizes are normally distributed.
                      Script 'create-test-file-dispersion.sh' can be found on the page
                              https://github.com/itmo-infocom/BigData/
    RemoteUser -- remote user on remote host, if omitted, local user selected
    RemoteHost -- remote host that data to be transferred to
    DestinationDirectory/dev/null -- directory (full path) on remote host where transferred data to be written. This 
                                     directory must be created beforehand or it can be just /dev/null
    Comments -- your comments, optional parameter
 

Parameters: <BBCPConfig> <BaseDir>, <SourceDirectory>, <RemoteUser>, <RemoteHost>, <DestinationDirectory/dev/null>, <Comments> are transferred to
script CopyData.bbcp. 


A parameter TCPParametersFile is a file having the following structure:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

first line is a set of tcp stream numbers delimited by spaces
second line is a set of tcp window sizes delimited by spaces
Comments beginning with hash sign '#' are allowed.

An example of TCPParametersFile:

# this is a file of 2 lines containing the set of tcp streams numbers  and tcp windows sizes (bytes) for measuring of influence
# of tcp streams number and tcp windows sizes on data transmit speed using script CopyData.bbcp
#  The comments at the beginning of a line are allowed in this file.
#
# first line is a set of tcp streams
# second line  is a set of tcp windows sizes
# elements on a line are delimited by spaces
# 
1 2 3 4 5 10 14 
 131072 262144 524288

If n = the number of tcp streams and  m = the number of tcp windows sizes then
total number of measurements:  k = n * m


On each mesurement with a pair of 'number_of_tcp_streams & tcp_window_size' the script Wrapper-CopyData.bbcp does the 
following steps:

1.  creates temporary file <SYSCTLFILE> with such content:

net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = htcp
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 30000
net.core.rmem_max = <tcp_window_size>
net.core.wmem_max = <tcp_window_size>
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 <tcp_window_size>
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 <tcp_window_size>

2. Run command sysctl -p <SYSCTLFILE>

3. Creates temporary config file for bbcp <BBCPConfigTMP> by adding to source config file  <BBCPConfig>  2 lines:

--windowsz <tcp_window_size>
--streams <number_of_tcp_streams> 

4. Adds to comments the following line:

tcp parameters: net.core.rmem_max = <tcp_window_size> net.core.wmem_max = <tcp_window_size> net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 <tcp_window_size>  net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 <tcp_window_size>

5. calls the script CopyData.bbcp with the parameters:

   CopyData.bbcp <BBCPConfigTMP> <BaseDir> <SourceDirectory> [<RemoteUser>@]<RemoteHost> <DestinationDirectory/dev/null> <Comments>
