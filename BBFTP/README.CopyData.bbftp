CopyData.bbftp
--------------

This bash script  is designed to test transfer of big size data (BigData) from local host to remote host
using utility 'bbftp' over Internet.

Description of bbftp parameters can be found on the page 
http://doc.in2p3.fr/bbftp/doc.3.2.1.html
and also using "man bbftp" and "man bbftpd" 

This script is run with the following input parameters:

CopyData.bbftp <bbftp_config_file> <BaseDir> <SourceDirectory> [<RemoteUser>@]<RemoteHost> <DestinationDirectory/dev/null> [<Comments>]

where:

    bbftp_config_file -- bbftp configuration file (full path), it can be empty. It is used for bbftp performance tuning  
    BaseDir -- directory (full path) where the script creates subdirectory to store input and logging information
    SourceDirectory -- directory or single file (full path) containing files to be transferred to remote host. This directory is created 
                      using script 'create-test-directory.sh'. 
                      Files sizes are normally distributed.
                      Script 'create-test-directory.sh' can be found on the page https://github.com/itmo-infocom/BigData/test-data
    RemoteUser -- remote user on remote host, if omitted, local user selected
    RemoteHost -- remote host that data to be transferred to
    DestinationDirectory/dev/null -- directory (full path) on remote host where transferred data to be written. This 
                                     directory can be also just /dev/null
    Comments -- your comments, optional parameter
 

This script invokes the script 'RunTop.sh' which runs command 'top -ibn 1' with specified interval.
The data privided by 'RunTop.sh' may be used to evaluate CPU & Memory consumption.

Kernel tcp/ip parameters should be set up beforehand under user 'root' to reach maximum throughput 
depending of the communication line bandwidth.

The script 'RunTop.sh' can be found on the page https://github.com/itmo-infocom/BigData/test-data


The script CopyData.bbftp creates under directory <BaseDir> subdirectory with name 

CopyData.bbftp.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>.<date>_<time>

in which the following files are created:

 ABSTRACT.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>
 COMMENTS.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>
 LOG.BBFTP.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>
 PING.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>
 TRACEROUTE.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>
 TOP.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>
 sosreport-<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>-<date><time>-<hash>.tar.xz

The file ABSTRACT.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost> has such content:

  Start time = <date time>
  Command line = <bbftp command line>
  Total data size to transfer(KB) = <value>
  Number of files = <value>
  Source directory with files = <value>
  Average file size(KB) = <value>
  File size dispersion = <value>
  Local host name = <value>
  Remote host name = <value>
  Remote host directory = <value>
  Data size transferred (KB) = <value>
  End time = <date time>
  Completion = YES/ABNORMAL
  Average transfer speed (KB/sec) = <value>

The file COMMENTS.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost> is filled with <Comments> + content of <bbftp_config_file>   
The file LOG.BBCP.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost> is filled with the output (log) of bbftp.
The file PING.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost> is filled with the output of 'ping -c 10 <RemoteHost>'
The file TRACEROUTE.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost> is filled with the output of 'traceroute <RemoteHost>'
The file TOP.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost> is filled with the output of 'RunTop.sh'
The file sosreport-<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>-<date><time>-<hash>.tar.xz is created by command
sosreport --batch --tmp-dir CopyData.bbftp.<LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>.<date>_<time> --name <LocalHost>.<RemoteHost>


THis script invokes bbftp command which remotely starts a bbftpd daemon on remote host through ssh tunnel (bbftpd -s).

In bbftp configuration file <bbftp_config_file> one can specify so called "behaviour commands" for bbftp performance 
tuning:

setbuffersize "Buffersize"   -- set the size in Kbytes of the buffer used for reading or writing the files.

setnbstream "NumberOfParallelStreams" -- set the number of parallel streams to NumberOfParallelStreams.  

setrecvwinsize "WindowSize" -- set size in Kbytes of the receive TCP window of each stream of the  bbftpd daemon. This also set 
                               the send window size of the client to the same value.

setsendwinsize "WindowSize" -- set size in Kbytes of the send TCP window of each stream of the  bbftpd daemon. This also set 
                               the receive window size of the client to the same value.

...
You can also put in <bbftp_config_file> bbftp command line parameter: -D[min:max]

Example of bbftp configuration file <bbftp_config_file>:

setoption nogzip
setnbstream 10
setbuffersize  4096
setrecvwinsize 4096
setsendwinsize 4096
-D5022:5040
